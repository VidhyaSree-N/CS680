To implement strategy design pattern ,

I have taken an example of text Editor where the user can edit the text like
- cropping : Crop the Given Text into half
- Uppercase : Convert the text to UpperCase
- LowerCase : Convert the text to LowerCase
- AddText : Add additional text to given text
- Styling : Change the style of text

I have implemented this with the help of strategy pattern by creating interface Editor.
All the editing types mentioned above implement Editor and TextEditor is the context that calls Editor.

For example implementation I have kept the functionalities minimum.
